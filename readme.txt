hi!!1!

thanks for buying le game.

No seriously, thanks.
If you think its a virus or trojan, it is NOT.
It is simply a python file, and my peanut brain cannot
understand past the boundary of the language :)

Unless if you didn't get it from the official page which is
my itch.io page, you're most definetely gonna get a virus

Read the guide before exploring around with the menu aspects
of the game, I haven't added a tutorial for that yet, sorry!

Please support Karmatic, they have made a good game :)
This game is also based on it!

They have a Discord too, so check that out as well

please dont sue me :( - ElectricSplash

All rights go to Karmatic
Based on the game Exp Minima
